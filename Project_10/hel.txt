Set interrupt for IOT_LINK going high (disconnecting) to reset IOT module

Add some sort of plastic between 2nd board and lower pins

-Add some sort of real-time operating system 
	**use ACLK as main source for timers;
	**go into LPM0
	**main loop covers updates with interrupt-flag run state machine

OS can be (among others): Round-Robin, Foreground-Background, Function-queue, RTOS, etc

Turn off IR LED when IOT is on

Utilization (percentage) = Task execution time / task execution period
